Important Terms
Image: Image is the executable application package file inside Docker. It contains everything needed to run an application, including libraries, config files, runtime, etc. It's a snapshot of a container. 

Container: An instance of an image is called a container. When an image is executed and takes place in memory, then the instance of this image is called a container. It executes in a completely isolated environment.

In OOP terms, Image is a class, and a container is an instance of this class — a runtime object.
Registry: A registry is a storage and content delivery system that stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a popular Docker registry. We can store different versions of images with different tag numbers to Docker Hub.  

Dockerfile: It's a text file that contains all the commands to assemble an image.
